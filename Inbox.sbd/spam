Wall St Report

How was your easter? Mine was not bad.

The problem with easter is that there isn't enough gifting like during =
christmas for example, but luckily a friend of mine called me a few =
hours ago and told me that he heard that the stock RCHA is going to soar =
past a dollar in the coming weeks.

I just bought it for around 28 cents. If you move fast I think you can =
grab it for around the same price too.

The general markets have been really tough lately and I think this =
little biotech company will finally give us an edge to make a few bucks. =
Move fast though.

Fat guys hate to see themselves in the mirror.

Taking care of their fluffy bodies is a real ordeal. Exposing all those =
bulges and layers of ugly flesh in front of the sporty crowd on a =
popular beach is the worst nightmare imaginable.

Remember that thing can be different for you if you choose to take the =
right kind of products for burning excessive body fat.

Take it regularly for a few weeks (or month if you are really obese) and =
see new hot and slender you in every single mirror reflection!
